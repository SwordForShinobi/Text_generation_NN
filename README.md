# Text_generation_NN
Several .py scripts connected to each other to generate some text

Pay attention to pathes in scripts
Executive file name is Parser_for_load.py It should be run via terminal like this:
python path/Parser_for_load.py seed_text size

Or if you dislike this way(like I do) remove all lines connected to argparse from Parser_for_load.py
And you can run it as usual in your PyCharm

There is also jupyter notebook for casuals (like myself)

P.S. (For Tinkoff guys): believe it or not, but it's a third variety of NN.
The problem is in task requirments. One of which is that training time of NN should be within an hour
with no GPU usage, which is quite tough as for me.
